# GC-1Project

##Description
They must render at least one sun and several planets that are aligned to a plane. This plane is known as the ecliptic plane and results from the conservation of angular momentum in the formation of the system. 
The planets must translate in an orbit (it can be circular) and must rotate about their axis.
